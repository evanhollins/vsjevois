# jevois README

This extension is going to replicate the functionality of Jevois inventor, but in a bit more familiar and powerful editor, VS Code.

## Features

Below is the list of features that are being worked on, with their current status.
- [ ] Loading python code from jevois
- [ ] Saving python code to jevois
- [ ] Console sending and recivieving
- [ ] Setting camera parameters

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

No extra requirements besides VS code at the moment, although I imagine that might change if a camera viewer is added.

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
